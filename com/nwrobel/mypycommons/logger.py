Module containing functionality for configuring and retrieving logger instances, which can be used
as a better alternative to print statements for debugging, info, error, etc purposes.

def initSharedLogger(logDir, logFilename=''):
    '''
    Creates/initializes and configures a the project shared logger instance, which will be used 
    as the go-to logger instance for all functions and modules to use when defining
    log messages in the code.

    The logger is configured by default to send all log statements to the console and to a log file, 
    located in the project root folder, with the same name as the module python file for which this logger is for.

    Details - this function creates the following default configuration for the shared logger:
    - the logger will allow all messages to be passed to the handlers (debug or higher)
    - the logger has two handlers, which define how the messages should be output, which ones to output, etc:
        - a file handler, which writes all messages (debug or higher) to a log file of the given name:
            the log file will be placed in the BFT logs dir
        - a stream (console output) handler, which outputs all messages (debug or higher) to the console/stdin

    Params:
        - logFilename: Name of the log file to which the file handler will output the log messages.
            By default, uses the name of the calling script + the .log file extension.
        - logDir: directory in which to store the log file

def setSharedLoggerConsoleOutputLogLevel(logLevel):
    '''
    Modifies the configuration of the shared logger by setting the minimum level of importance (log
    level) that log messages need to have in order to be logged to the console.
    
    NOTE: this only changes the log level for the console output handler: the log level for the file
    output handler will not be changed (debug and higher by default).

    This function is useful if the log level needs to be changed later in the script code: for instance, 
    if the user wants to change it interactively so that the console is not flooded with log messages.

    Params:
        - logLevel: one of the following log level string values: debug, info, warning, error
